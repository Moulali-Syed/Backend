Day3:
command to initialize npm

npm init


this creates package.json - which has configuration to manage dependencies

we have dev dependencies and normal dependencies

browserslist - this will help to make our app accessible on different browser versions 

========================================================================
We need to convert our code in such a way that older browsers can also understand

polyfill - this will convert newer version of our code to older version 

babel - converts our newer code to older versions of code, so that older browsers can also
understand 
this can be kept track using the browserslist , present in package.json

we donot write polyfill , babel will do on its own 

babel - is a js code , which can be in node modules 
newer code converted to older code - this is known as polyfill 


parcel - will remove unwanted code this is known as tree shaking
say our library has 10 or 20 functions, but i want to use few of them
parcel is very smart it ignores unwanted code 

webpack - is also bundler , has similar functionalities as parcel 

========================================================================

to run our app 
we are using
npx parcel index.html  //index.html is entry point of our app

we can write this in package.json - scripts tag 

"scripts": {
    "start":"parcel index.html",  //<----------------******--------
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  }

now we can run using
npm run start 

----
similarly for build command
npx parcel build index.html 

  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },

we can skip , npx - is for executing
npm run build 
------------------
short cut to run is
npm start    | this is similar to npm run start 


----------
we have to configure of project , to remove console.log

we have to use babel plugin
babel-plugin-transform-remove-console , this removes our console.log 

npm install babel-plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev

to use it , create a .babelrc file
