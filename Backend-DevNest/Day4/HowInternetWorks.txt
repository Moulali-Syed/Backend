data reaches satellite and then reach us

lets say our computer connected to internet

our computer has a IP address, which varies

say i searched google.com , it has some IP address = 152.22.152.3
we get this from a DNS server

--------------------------

rules by which data is transferred is protocols
we have TCP/IP - transports data    
        HTTP/HTTPS - Web Access
        RTP - Live video , Streaming , VOIP calls


===========================================================================

API
Application programming Interface - set of programming codes that enables data transmission
    between one software product and another


    WebApp in Browser --Request--> Internet -----> API ----->  WebServer ----> Database

    WebServer is not an api , we develop api on it 


There are three approaches to API release policies

Private - the API is only for use internally , this gives companies the most control over their API 
            like Node apps, react apps running on local server 
Partner - APIs is shared with specific business partners , this can provide additional
        revenue streams witjout compromising quality
        like apis used to have access only to employees in a company

Public - API is available to everyone , this allows third parties to develop
        apps that interact with your api and can be a source for innovation

 VPN -  to protect from hacking , vpn will sends its IP address , instead of ours 
        thus vpn will be safe and not accessible to others

=========================================================

REST - representational state transfer
    it is a set of rules which says how do we handle req and response 

    instead of REST we have SOAP and many

Simple and Standard
Scalable and stateless
High Performance , can be cached


CREATE - POST 
READ  - GET 
Update - PUT 
Delete - DELETE 

===================================================================
Node JS

we create APIs using Node JS 

accept a request , process it , if need to save on DB save it , send the response 

Node js - can deal with high latency
node js is very easy way to build scalable rest api projects 
because it has event loop 

it is very to work on json , node is very secure and performant , a high developer 
community as front end and backend developers both know this
