Introduction to Backend Development:
Front end is cute puppy
Backend is beast with heavy logic 

Frontend resides in browsers - technologies are html , css , js - we have may frameworks react 

Backend - Node js , python , golang , PHP , java , Ruby 

Backend has servers , as we have browsers in front end 
we tell server what it should do , we can do this using Node Js 
and also databases 


Servers:
server is something which servers
in simple terms , they are computers without screen
can our laptop become server ? 
Yes it can become server , only condition is it should be serving
if it is publicly available or some files publicly and it is accessible to others
then it is behaving servers 

Databases:
is a place where the data resides is called database
example: chat , password, file, identity ,video ...

If we have all data in databases , then why do we need servers?
we need server is to serve the data , database only store data 

when we request from browser -- request will be sent to server -- server inturn ask database if it has 
that data and returns the data requested
all these are connected via internet 

browser understands html , server understands node js, database understands its own language
what internet understands? the language of internet is API
we make API call to send data and receive data 

API - Application Programming Interface
any langauge is a set of rules to help us or computer to do something 

backend, servers , database, apis -  jargons of backend 

API - helps in communicate between all Interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming is a just a set of rules 

To make our life easier , we have so much of code written 
we have c, c++ , java, python , javascript ---- all solves different problems

say i have million users watching a video live stream, then how can i 
concurrently serve all users 

say person A -  comes up with solution of adding many servers 
say person B - comes up with using desktop app 
say person C - 1 server -- 5 cores as solution 

these are all viable solutions 

in javascript we have event loop
what js done is 
it created a queue and divided that stream into small queue and serve according to need 
js is single thread ,but using event loop it is able to server 1 million users 

js in backend is Node Js 

====================================================================================================================
install node js 

of LTS support 

we can use node version manager to have multiple node versions 

nvm install v16
nvm use v16
