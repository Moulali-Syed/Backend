How Node Js Works , A look behind the scenes 

Node Js architecture behind the scenes:
node js -->  v8 , libuv[a open source library that helps in accessing file systems
    and also has event loop and thread pool concepts , libuv - is written in c++ ] , 

    and also has http-parser , c-ares, OpenSSL , zlib 


=======================================================================================
Processes , Threads and ThreadPool

nodejs process - instance of a program in execution on a computer

node runs in single thread (Sequence of instructions)
node will execute code one by one 

Initialize program  
        |
Execute 'top-level' code
        |
Require modules
        |
Register event callbacks
        |
Start Event Loop 

event loop - will also be not able to handle some operations that are more time consuming
for this we have Thread Pool - Additional 4 Threads (or more),this offload work from event loop 
handle heavy("expensive") tasks:
File System APIs
Cryptography
Compression
DNS lookups 

=======================================================================================

Event Loop:

        node js process

            single thread 
                Event Loop 

when we Start node app - event loop starts simultaneously

we also have callback queue
    Expired Timer callbacks
    I/O polling and callbacks 
    setImmediate callbacks
    Close callbacks
