Intro to Backend Developement:

An overview on how the web works:


client(browser) ----------Request------------------> Server

client(browser) <---------Response------------------ Server 

https://www.google.com/maps

https - protocol 
www.google.com  - domain name 
maps - resource 

www.google.com is not actual domain name , its just an easy name to memorize 
the conversion of domain name to real address happens by DNS 
DNS - Domain Name Server , this happens thru the ISP(Internet Service Provider)

the real address looks something as below

https://216.58.211.206:443 

https  - protocol 
216.58.211.206 - IP address 
443 - port number 

Then a connection between client and server happens , 
Client ------TCP/IP socket connection ----- Server

this connection will be for entire time , till all files are transferred from website 
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol 
IP - Internet Protocol 

TCP/IP are communication protocols , that describes how the data is transferred over web 

HTTP request :
client and server communicates with HTTP Request 

we have mostly used GET , POST , PUT 

Then server sends 
HTTP Response 


1.DSN Lookup
2.TCP/IP socket connection
3.HTTP Request
4.HTTP Response
5.index.html is the first to be loaded ,Scanned for assets : JS,CSS, images - Process is repeated for each file 

===================================================================================
HTTP in action:

open udemy.com 
in chrome open dev tools 
Then In Network tab , disable cache - so that we dont load website from our computer
now reload , we will see the requests that were made 

click on www.udemy.com , u will see the request headers and response headers 

===================================================================================
static vs dynamic vs api 

static - contains - html , css , js , no work done on server 

dynamic - they usually has database , fetches data from db ,build  website of html ,css , js 
if we see twitter website , it will be different each day [Server side rendering]
[the website getting build at server side - we call them server side rendered]


API - database --> get Data ---> only json data is sent 
    Building API and consuming API on client side 
    we use some frontend frameworks like React, Angular to show the data 
    by doing this the build website part moved to the frontend part that is to client 
[the website getting build at client side are called client side rendered]


API can be consumed by any web app , native mobile app , native mobile app 
    native IOS app , native windows app 
    thus a huge advantage , we can use same api in different apps
