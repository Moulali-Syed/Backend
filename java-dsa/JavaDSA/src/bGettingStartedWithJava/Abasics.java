/*
Java is platform Independent

we write code and want to run 
but hardware understand only binary 0,1

but we understand decimal

java is high level language

so we need a mediator - compiler
this converts the code into binary

binary outcome can be different based on the operarting system

now we get problem while we share the executable file, this might not run on other OS machines

but java dealt with this problem

we complie and get .class file which is same on all platforms - different OS

now we can share .class file and it can run on all platforms

all this is because of JVM -  which is platform dependent
this JVM can convert .class file into binary code that the particular platform can understand
