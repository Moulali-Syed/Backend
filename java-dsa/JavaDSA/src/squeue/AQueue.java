/*
 Queue is also an abstract data structure
 when we talk about queue , we talk about what functionalities does it provides
 to us , not how deep down it is 
 
 Queue works in FIFO
 
 it is same as people taking bus in a queue , bus queue 
 
 First In First Out 
 
 Queue is open ended in both sides 
 
 
 Insertions in queue - happen at the end  (rear end)
 deletion in queue happens from the begining (front end)
 
 
 
 functions we have in queue
 		size
 		isEmpty
 		enqueue  - this is to insert
 		front - to get the element at front
 		
 		dequeue - to remove from front
