Whenever we get a problem to solve

1.Analyze the problem
2.Think of the solution
3.Pen down the solution
4.Write code for the problem

To follow this we can use a flowchart

What is a flowchart?
1.Diagrammatic representation illustrating  a solution to a given problem
2.This allows you to break down the problem into simple smaller
  steps and helps to represent in a visually pleasing way
3.Flowcharts are very good for documentation 


Flowchart Components:
Start/End - Terminator
parallelogram - Input/Output
Rectangle -  Process
Rhombus  - Decision 
Arrow -  Connector, indicates the flow


Example:
Add Two Numbers?

Start
parallelogram box - take input a , b
rectangle box - Process -- add a+b and store it in sum
parallelogram box - output -- print sum
End


Example:
Read Principle, Rate of interest and Time and Print Simple Interest

Start
read principle,RI, Time
calculate P*T*R/100 
print SI
End
