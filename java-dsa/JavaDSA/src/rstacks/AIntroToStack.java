/*
 For now we have seen array - but we need to specify how many elements
 it can store before hand
 
 LinkedList - we need not specify how much memory it will take before hand
 
 both has its own advantages and disadvantages
 
 Lets see Stack 
 
 from stack - we consider what features does a stack have
 
 Stack is considered as a Abstract Data Structure
 
 Stack has a behaviour - LIFO [Last In First Out]
 
 addition and removal are only done at one end 
 
 
 Where can we see stack in programming - it can be seen call stack 
 all our recursive function calls will be in the call stack
