package rstacks;
/*
 operations that we can perform on a stack
 
 push element at top most - push operation/insert into stack
 top - to read top most element from stack
 
 pop - to remove top most element from stack 
 
 
 size
 
 isEmpty()
 
 we cannot insert in between , we cannot access all the content in stack
 so thats why it is called abstract data type 
 
 
 --------
 example
 
 i have a stack 
 		i pushed 10 
 		top will be 10
 		size will be 1
 		
 		i again pushed 20
 		top will be 20
 		size will be 2
 		
 		say i pushed 30
 		top will be 30
 		size will be 3
 		
 		say i want to do pop - removes top most element , 30, size will be 2
 		top will be 20 now
