What is Java?

Java is high level object oriented programming language
most of its syntax derived from c , c++

Java is platform because java has its own run time environment (JRE)
--------------------------------------------------------------

java has 3 main editions:

1.J2SE - Java 2 Standard Edition (Core Java)
2.J2EE - Java 2 Enterprise Edition(Advance Java)
3.J2ME - Java 2 Micro Edition(it has been replaced by Android)

J2SE has core java fundamentals , using this we can build standalone
 applications ,desktop applications


J2EE - in this edition we learn server side programming .this helps to built
		enterprise level applications 
		
J2ME - in this edition we learn micro programming , helps in building mobile applications

--------------------------------------------------------------

Java History:
Sun microsystems - James Gosling and his team thought of building a more flexible language
which can run on platform independent 

idea came because - need of language which is simple ,platform independent ,tight coded
programming language 

Starting its name was Oak , later to Java

first this was under Sun micro systems , later under Oracle

java started in 1991 , after 4 years 1995 java is released

Symbol: Coffee

--------------------------------------------------------------
Versions of java:
We can search in wikipedia page 

Java 8 and Java 11 - are LTS 

--------------------------------------------------------------
What is difference between java,c,c++ ?
1.Programming Paradigm 
	C - Procedural
	C++ - OOP
	java  - pure OOP[99%]

2.Origin
	C - is assembly language
	C++ - based on C
	java  - based on C and C++
	
3.Designed by and year
	C- Dennis Ritchie - 1972
	C++ - Bjarne Stroustrup - 1979
	java - James Gosling - 1995
	
4.Translator
	C - compiler 
	C++ - compiler
	java - interpreter and compiler

5.Static/dynamically  language
In any language , if the primitive data types allocates memory during compile time
then it is a static langauge

In any language , if the primitive data types allocates memory during run time 
then it is dynamic language

C- static lang
C++ - static lang
java - dynamic lang[all primitive types will get memory allocated during run time]

6.Pre Processor directives
	C - support headers
	C++ - also support headers  - thus c , c++ require pre-processors
	java - use packages(import)
	
7.Platform dependent/independent

	C , C++ - platform dependent
	Java - platform independent
	
	
8.Pointers
	C, C++ supports pointers
	Java doesnot support pointers 
	
9.Inheritance
	C - doesnot have inheritance
	C++ - supports inheritance
	Java - support inheritance but not multiple inheritance  
	
10.OVER Loading
	C - doesnot support overloading
	C++ - supports overloading both function and operator overloading
	java - supports overloading but not operator overloading
	
11.Destrcutors
	C - doesnot support 
	C++ - supports
	java - doesnot support destrcutor , as it has garbage collector
	
12.File generated
	 C - .exe , C++ - .exe
	 java - .class file 
	 
13.call by value, reference
	 C, C++ supports both
	 java - only supports call by value

Interview Questions:

How java is dynamic programming language?
primtive datatypes that gets memory allocated at compile time then it is static
if it get allocated at run time then it is dynamic


Why java doesnot need headers?
Because it uses packages and import thus no need of headers

Why java doesnot support pointers?
Pointers will only come into picture when there is static memory allocation
but in java memory allocation happens at run time
Java is platform independent

What is call by value and call by reference?as no pointers concept there is no call by ref in java

why java has good memory management?
It is because of garbage collector
