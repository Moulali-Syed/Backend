 * Difference between Java and Python
1.Programming Paradigm

	Java - OOP based(from java SE8 - java introduced procedural oriented laguage features
		like lambda expressions, functional Interface ,Functions,Predicates
		Module System[from java 9] ,...etc)
	Python - is both procedural and OOP based
	
2.Statically and Dynamically Typed Programming language
	Java - Statically Typed Programming language, we must tell the type of datatype
			int rollNo ; String name;
	Python - Dynamically Typed Programming language 
				rollNo ,name
	
3.Compilative/Interpretive language:
	Java is compilative and interpretive programming language
	Python is Interpretive programming language

4.Translator
	java has both compiler and interpreter , but python has only interpreter
	no need of compiling we can execute directly in python 
	
5.Speed
	java is faster compared to python 
	
6.Portability:
  java is more portable because it supports more hardware devices
  python is less portable as compared to java 
  
 7.Inheritance:
 	java - supports all except multiple inheritance
 	python - supports all
 	
 8.syntax:
  use of semicolon in mandatory in java
  semicolon not mandatory in python
  
9.Use of curly braces{}
	it is mandatory in java
	not used in python , python uses indentation
	
10.Syntax:
	Java: hard coded , if we miss ;, {} gives error
	python: easy syntax
	
11.length of code
	more lines of code in java
	python has less lines of code 
	
12.Database compatiablity
	java is more compatibale because of JDBC 
	python is less compatibale with database , due to this python rarely used in distributed applications
		enterprise applications
		
13.Frameworks:
	Java provides more frameworks - Spring, Hibernate , Struts
	Python has less frameworks - Django , Flask
	
14.Machine learning libraries
	java: Weka, Mallet , DeepLearning4j, MOA  etc
	python : Tensorflow, pytorch etc -  these are famous compared to java ones
	
15.Best for which area:
	enterprise , desktop, mobile applications - java
	scientific and numeric computing , machine leraning , AI - python
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
Java Features:

1.Java is simple - java uses simplified syntax of c and c++
					some c, c++ things like pointers removed, added garbage collector
					less execution time period , less maintenance(less memory,less power)
2.Platform Independent:
	java can execute on any platform
	if we write java code compile it , then the .class file can run on any machine
	
3.Portable
	java is portable as it can run on multiple hardware
	
4.Java is OOP , thus java works around objects

java supports many OOP features 

5.Security
	Java is more secure language , say we dont have pointers which has the address referecne
	as java doesnot hav pointers so secure
	java has byte code verifier - to check if code is correct according to java syntac
	java has security manager //53 minutes
--------------------------------------------------------------

How java is platform independent?

Java has JVM - which is platform dependent - this will convert .class file according to its
	platform and executes the code
