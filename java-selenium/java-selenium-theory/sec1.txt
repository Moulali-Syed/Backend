Selenium WebDriver Architecture :
--------------------------------
we write code in an IDE say eclipse ---> after i trigger my test ---> all the code will be converted to JSON
this JSON will be sent to server which is nothing but a browser driver over an http protocol
every browser has its own browser driver , this browser driver will communicate with actual browser and executes
commands by interpreting json which it received on browser
browser driver receives responses back from browser and it sends json response back to client

code---> converted to json on trigger --> transferred over http protocol to browser driver --> browser driver will communicate with actual browser
--> and executes actions ---> and then response will be sent back as json to our code editor

selenium Client Library ------JSON(http)----------> browserDrivers --------> browsers
