Typescript is superset of javascript


Typescript is not about reinventing javascript

Don't use typescript unless it is necessary 


Typescript is all about Type Safety


TypeSafety is nothing but javascript allows to do some odd things

        like   2+"2" = '22'  , this shouldnot have been allowed ,happening because of no typesafety 
        2+null = 2
        undefined+2 = NaN

What Typescript does :
                Static Checking , this is only job done by typescript 
                this is done by many languages like  , Java , Go lang 

What is static checking?
When we are writing code the syntax of language  will be continuosly checked by IDEs 
but not in javascript , it will only be checked when we see in browser env or node js run time 

It will be a great help , if there is a static checker that checks my code when i try to 
write it

Typescript - whole job is to Analyze the code as we type . That's it 


Our TypeScript code will be transpiled/compiled to JavaScript code

TypeScript is a development tool . Your project still runs JS 
The chances of producing errors is less 


We can see typescript running in ---> typescriptlang.org ,  https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#

if i write below code in a ts playground , i will get a red swiggly line , indicating that
the property is not present

let user = {name:'apple',age:1};

console.log(user.email);

but at the end of day it is converted to javascript and when we run it will give result as
undefined  


TypeScript is just a wrapper around javascript, remember it is a development tool

2.with config file in react projects 
        npm install typescript --save-dev 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       

create a intro.ts file  


console.log('Moulali Syed');

let user = { name: 'moulali', age: 10 };

console.log(user.name);

/*
but this typescript not gonna work in production


we have to do
        tsc intro.ts

        this will create a intro.js file for us
