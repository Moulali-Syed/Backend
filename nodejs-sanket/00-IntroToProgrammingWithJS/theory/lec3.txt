we can assume functions as black box

functions take input and process and gives an output 

we have inbuilt functions

console.log();
this function takes some data as input and then displays it in output 


console.log('Apple');//Apple
console.log(10);//10

we can even pass multiple values
console.log()


let a = 10;
let b = 'apple';
console.log(a, b);//10 apple
