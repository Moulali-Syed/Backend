Bitwise operator:

computer internally understands only binary

5 - 101 [binary representation of 5]

bitwise operators perform the corresponding operations bit by bit 


& - bitwise AND 
| - bitwise OR 
^ - bitwise XOR 
~ - bitwise NOT 

5&&7 = 7[logical AND]
---------------
5 & 7
101 111  

101 = 5

6 & 9 
0110
1001

0000 = 0
