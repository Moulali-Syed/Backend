Basics of JS:
it is a multi paradigm language 

Any peace of software we built should store some information

Program in running state is called process 

to see all processes running on our machine - look in task manager, on mac activity monitor

ram - is primary storage area 


When dealing with programming language , we cannot modify some words
these are called keywords - reserved words by language for its own purpose
we cannot change their meaning or repurpose them for a different use case 


In JS few keywords are - let , for , const , var , if , else , return ....etc
