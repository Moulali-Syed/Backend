coding variables in javascript:
------------------------------

to run js code - go to extensions in vs code 
search for code runner 
and install it

this will give us a play button 

------

we have 3 ways to create variables

using var keyword:
var <variableName> = <value>;

var marks = 90;
var score = 100;


using let keyword:
let <variableName> = <value>;

let age = 12;
let flag = 0;


using const keyword:
const <variableName> = <value>;
const x = 100;

----------------
to run code - click on run option that we get from code runner 

-------
semicolon:
when we write one line of js code , it is equivalent to one instruction given to computer 
one complete instruction is called statement, at end of each statement we can put semicolon
but it is optional


varialeNaming convention:
it is recommended to use camelCase 
variable names can contain small alphabets , capital alphabets , digits 
underscore(_) , $

we cannot have space or any other special character 
we should give meaningful names so that reader can identify the names properly 
variable name cannot start with digit but it can have digits in between or at last 
we cannot use keywords as variableName

//invalid variable name
const first name = 'Apple';

const 3address  = 'asf';

const %aefg  = 'fgf';
