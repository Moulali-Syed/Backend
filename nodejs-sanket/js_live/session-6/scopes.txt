scope - represents  the visibility of the variables 

everything inside your code will be used in one of the following 2 ways 
1.either it will be getting some value assigned to it
2.or some value will be retrieved from it


How javascript is executed?
javascript is not purely interpreted and it is also not purely compiled  

if our js is interpreted then below code must have at least executed the first line
console.log('hello');
function fun() {
    console.....log('ansf');
}

but our javascript code will throw error without printing anything

-----
it is not even purely compiled

console.log('hi')
console.lo('we);
it will print hi and then throw error in seen thru browser console



compiler - reads whole code and throw error if any error is found 
javascript is compiled and interpreted as well
