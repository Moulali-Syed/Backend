Promises:

we have 2 problems with call backs  - 1.Inversion of Control 2.callback hell a readability problem 

Promises are nothing but readability enhancers 
They can solve problem of Inversion of control 


Promises are special type of objects that get returned immediately when we call them 


lets recap Inversion of control
function fun(x,cb){
    cb();
}

fun(10,()=>{
    console.log('done');
})

problem with this is we dont know whether the higher order function is gonna execute our callback 
function or not
