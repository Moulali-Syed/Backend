we can see what different companies are using their tech stacks 
we can look from a website- stackshare.io 


we can observe - every company is not depending on one tech stack , every company 
                 has got their backend and frontend in different tech stacks 

tech stack doesnot matter - it depends on use case 

Business cares profit 


Backend engineer --> play with data , databases , implement backend API for different functionalities

    as a user we can interact with any frontend ui in webapp/ios/android
    as business logic is from backend , the code should be good 

    Node JS is good for high input output 
    Machine learning - python
    banking application - java
    microservices- c#

================================================================================================
Why javascript?

we can build frontend , cross platform apps , server side logic , and a lot of ML libraries - tensorflow.js 

web3 - 

small scale companies can work with same javascript resource 
electron.js - for desktop applications

All this is possible after 2009 only 
================================================================================================
we will see Rest API , grpc 

Monolith , microservices architecture

What happens when i write 
    www.google.com --- inside browser

    as a user i write a url in client , client doesnot have business logic
    they try to reach server 

    browser will do a DNS query(Domain name server) and gets corresponding ip address
    we also have a local cache of the DNS , if it is not in local then it will contact
    with ISP - Internet service provider and gets corresponding ip address 

    DNS is a key value pair ,key is the search we want to do and the value is ip address 

    we can see our local DNS , we have seperate tools to check them 

    we can check in cmd - ipconfig /all , the DNS 


    once we get ip address - we hit the load balancer and route our request to a healthy server
    which can serve to us 

    load balancer - this will be configured by cloud providers like aws 
    a lot of things like cache , db servers will be there involved to show the website we hit in our browser


As a backend engineer it is not just serving the webpage in front end 

say i go to bookmyshow - there we can see same experience on both mobile and desktop 
all this because of backend 

================================================================================================

history of javascript:

javascript is no where related to java 

original name of javascript is ECMAScript


we can store data , make decisions, repeat tasks - all features in other languages
we have them in javascript
