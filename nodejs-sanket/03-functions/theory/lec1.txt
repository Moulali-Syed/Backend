DRY - dont repeat yourself

if we write a piece of code it should be reusable 

we should be repeating it every time 

say i write logic to check , if the input number is positive or negative

say u have to do same thing multiple times

instead of writing it many times , we can reuse the same every where using functions

#if we make mistake , then we can change at only one place
#if requirement change, then also change at a single place
