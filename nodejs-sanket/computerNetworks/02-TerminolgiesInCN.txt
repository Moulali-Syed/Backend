Protocols:
there should be certain set of rules while sharing information , that gave birth to Protocols
it is a set of rules 

in computer terms - protocols are a set of rules and regulations setup to communicate 
and share information over a network    
Example:
HTTP, UDP , TCP , SMTP(to send and receive mails )..etc


--------------
Packets:
In order to share data we cannot send big chunk of data over the network 
say a pipe can have only some inflow thru it , similarly we cannot send big amount of data 
at a time , we need to divide this data into smaller chunks , these small chunks are called
packets 

--------------
Address:
Sending Messages over the network requires the destination details 
This detail uniquely identifies the end system is called address 
in modern times we have ip address which can give accurate address 

--------------
Ports:
When we send parcel to friend , then we have to refer a particular person in whole family member
in our computer system as well , we must identify who has to recieve , which process should 
receive the data is mentioned by Ports

Any machine could be running many network aplications, in order to distinguish these apps 
for receiving messages we use ports .it is also called as port number 

port helps u get the packets to specific process on the host 

Every process has a 16 bit port number
it range from 0 to 2^16 = 65535 [range of port numbers]


0-1023 ---> well known ports, these ports are reserved for particular applications
example: port 80 for http , port 443 -https

1024 - 49152 ----> registered ports 
we can register our node apps,... 
they are used by specific ,potentially properitary apps or process that are known but are 
not system define 

27017 - mongodb server connected to this port 

49153 - 65535 ----> dynamic ports , reserved for future purpose     

--------------

combination of ----> IP Address + Port = Socket
